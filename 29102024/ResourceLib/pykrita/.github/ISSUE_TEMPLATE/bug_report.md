**General info**
- Plugin version: ... [example: v1.1.0]
- Operating System: ... [example: Windows 10, Ubuntu 22.04, macOS Sierra]

**Bug description**
Describe the issue you encounter.
- If the plugin crashes and you get a traceback window - make sure to paste its content here.
- You can attach screenshots if it helps to describe your issue.

Ideally:
- check if the bug also occurs on the `development` branch (on github overview page, switch from 'main' to 'development', then download and install the plugin)
- try to break down when the bug happens (always/occasionally), and what is needed for it to happen

When the bug is fixed, close the issue. After not getting a response from you for a week, I will close it myself.
